Challenge 4: Intercellular Communication in Cardiovascular Disease 
Single-cell sequencing is a key tool for assessing disease progression at the cellular level. In 
atherosclerosis, single-cell transcriptomic analysis has provided insights into plaque-specific 
macrophage differentiation. Cell Chat, an open-source R package, infers intercellular communication 
networks from single-cell transcriptomic data on ligand-receptor or pathway level.  

However, the ligand-receptor communication network is limited by its reliance on curated peer
reviewed datasets, which often lack comprehensive disease-specific interactions. Understanding 
communication differences between diseased and healthy groups can be challenging due to 
insufficient literature annotations. Furthermore, analyzing the vast number of potential intercellular 
communications is both time-consuming and difficult to contextualize within known cardiovascular 
disease mechanisms. 
High-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing data is crucial for disease characterization. Within the 
curATime cluster, this data can identify cell-type-specific targets for diseases like atherothrombosis. 
Efficient analysis of CellChat outputs can simplify interpretation and aid in identifying potential drug 
targets. Automated literature integration can reduce manual effort in analyzing large communication 
networks.  
In the context of the curATarget and the curAIknow project, the challenge is to develop a framework 
that explains differences in intercellular communication between cardiovascular disease and healthy 
groups. This framework should leverage existing literature and knowledge bases, enrich datasets with 
relevant interactions, and discover new mechanisms. It should also account for interaction 
probabilities. The goal is to create a knowledge graph that integrates annotations, CellChat outputs, 
and novel findings to provide actionable insights.
